# How to Build a Slack App!
This is a simple tutorial about how to program a slack app using **Python** and **Flask**. 

This serves as a walkthrough guide and example of the types of Slack apps you can build with Slack's Python SDK, python-slackclient, and Slack Events Adapter, which facilitates the handling of data from the Slack Events API in Python. We'll cover all the basic steps you'll need to have a fully functioning app that can listen and respond to events in slack, handle slash commands, and so much more!

## 1. Creating the Slack App

## 2. Responding to Slack Events

## 3. Integrating Slash Commands

## 4. Example App: COVID-Bot
For this tutorial, I have included code for a simple slack bot that responds to requests for up to date COVID-19 statistics through slash commands. Users can request information for specific countries or states as well. 

## 5. Running the App
